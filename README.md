# Rundeck Plugin Examples
This repo serves as the main knowledge base for how Rundeck plugins should look.

Each plugin will be updated to match the latest guidelines in our 
[Plugin Development Guidelines](https://pagerduty.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RUNDECK/pages/2878472445/Workflow+Step+Node+Step+Plugins+Development+Guidelines),
and will be available for you to dissect, edit, and build for testing purposes.

## A note on [rundeck/rundeck/examples](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/tree/main/examples)
Historically, example plugin code has existed in the [examples folder](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/tree/main/examples) of the Rundeck project.
However, this code is in need of a refresh to come into alignment with our new guidelines (among other things).

To that end, you'll see those examples updated and migrated here over time. Keep checking back for more example code!
