# Rundeck Plugin Examples
This repo serves as the main knowledge base for how Rundeck plugins should look.

Each plugin will be updated to match the latest guidelines in our 
[Plugin Development Guidelines](https://pagerduty.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RUNDECK/pages/2878472445/Workflow+Step+Node+Step+Plugins+Development+Guidelines),
and will be available for you to dissect, edit, and build for testing purposes.
