# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file, patches or ignores known vulnerabilities.
version: v1.0.0

# REPOSITORY TYPE: Configuration-only documentation repository
# SECURITY POSTURE: This repository contains only example code, documentation, and configuration files
# RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES: None - this repository does not deploy or execute in production environments
#
# This .snyk file serves to:
# 1. Satisfy organizational Snyk scanning requirements
# 2. Document that this is a configuration-only repository with Rundeck plugin examples
# 3. Provide context for security teams reviewing scan results
#
# The repository contains:
# - Rundeck plugin examples in various languages (Java, Groovy, scripts)
# - Build configuration files (Gradle, Maven)
# - Documentation and README files
# - No production runtime dependencies or executable Node.js code that would be deployed
#
# Security considerations:
# - Example plugins are for educational purposes and should not be deployed to production without security review
# - Build dependencies in individual plugin examples should be reviewed separately if used
# - This repository itself introduces no runtime security vulnerabilities as it's documentation-only

# Configuration for examples/documentation repository
ignore: {}

# No patches required as this is a documentation repository with no runtime dependencies
patch: {}

# Language settings - primarily for documentation scanning compliance
